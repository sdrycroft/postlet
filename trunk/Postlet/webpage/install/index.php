					<p>Installation of Postlet couldn't be simpler.  All that is required is that you drop the Postlet.jar file into a directory on your webserver, and then edit an HTML page to look similar to my <a href="../example/">example page</a>.</p><p>Getting file upload support on your server however, may be much more difficult.  For this reason, I've written a very short <a href="test.html">HTML page</a> which mimics the way that Postlet sends files to a server.  It is recommended that you get file uploads to work with this first, before trying to get them to work with Postlet.</p>
